# Basic instructions

* Create a number of variants of the html + the js-file (now named index.html + main.js), so that each html-file has it's own js-file and functions differently. All pages shall use the same css file

# Features
  * A function that calculates age from birth date
  * Filter by last name, and sort by last name.
  * Filter by email, and sort by email
  * Filter by age, and sort by age (and display the age)
  * A page where you can choose what to sort by from a select
  * Improve the looks of the page by editing the css
  * A menu system that let us switch between the different pages (using a-tags/links)

# Work-flow
Since this is a test/exercise of working i a team with programming:
* Discuss and decide who takes each feature/task
* Are some task dependent on each other (like creating a menu system)?
* Work in separate feature branches in a git repo you all collobarate in. Who is going to set up the repo and invite others
* Do we need a Trello board? - Create one TODO, DOING, REVIEW, DONE - columns to keep track of who is working on what. (One person creates the board and shares it with the others.)
* Think about: VSC is not good for all Git-tasks, merging, cloning etc so consider either terminal commands or using GitHub Desktop - each team member can chose themself.
* You can uses Thomas' code as a starting point, but don't fork Thomas' repo, it's better to download Thomas's repo as a zip file, unzip and use as base for creating your own!
